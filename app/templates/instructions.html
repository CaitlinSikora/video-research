        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <p>Thanks for your willingness to participate in this study.</br></br>
        In this survey, you'll be asked to watch 3 short videos and label expressive movements. You will mark the timeline for each expressive movement you see. Then, you'll assign one of the following qualities to each movement from the drop down menu:</p>
        <ul class="list-options">
            <li>Slash</li>
            <li>Dab</li>
            <li>Wring</li>
            <li>Flick</li>
            <li>Punch</li>
            <li>Press</li>
            <li>Glide</li>
            <li>Float</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are no wrong answers here. Trust your intuition. There are no wrong answers. Just use your best instincts. At this point, you'll be asked to enter the emotions being expressed and the body parts involved in each movement. When you have finished adding all of the movements you see, you'll answer a few quick questions about the overall video. Please fill out the form completely. The video below will demonstrate.</p>
        <video id="video" controls preload="auto" height="400" canplaythrough='true'></video>
